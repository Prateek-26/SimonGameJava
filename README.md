Nostalgic Simon Game build using Java and Swing

What is Simon Game?
Originally it was an electronic game that was the most famous during the 90s.
The device creates a series of tones and lights and requires a user to repeat the sequence.
If the user succeeds, the series becomes progressively longer and more complex.
Once the user fails or the time limit runs out, the game is **over**. 

What's here in the repo?
I used Java and Swing to recreate that game, I had already done it using HTML, CSS and JS.
So basically when you run the app, you will have to click on start and then the game begins.
At each step either of the square color will pop and you will have to click it while remembering the color.(Along with color, I have also labelled it with numbers).
Now as long as you are able to remember the sequence you could continue in the game and once you fail to provide the same sequence you will have to restart the game.
The high score is not stored anywhere thus once you close the app the high score will reset to zero.

**Note:** If you are not able to see the next sequence being popped, then it means that the current color selected is your next sequence.

Thanks for your Patience. **Have a great day!**
